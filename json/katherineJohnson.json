"Katherine Johnson was born on August 26, 1918, in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, USA. She displayed a remarkable aptitude for mathematics from a young age and was enrolled in high school by the age of 10, which was a rare opportunity for African-American students in the segregated South at the time. After completing her education, Johnson began her career as a teacher and later joined the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), which would later become NASA, in 1953. Her work primarily involved performing complex mathematical calculations, especially related to the trajectories and flight paths of aircraft. Katherine Johnson's precision and expertise in mathematics quickly gained her recognition within the organization. One of Katherine Johnson's most notable contributions came during the early years of the Space Race. Her calculations were instrumental in determining the trajectory for the first American in space, Alan Shepard, during the Mercury-Redstone 3 mission in 1961. Her work was critical in ensuring that the spacecraft's launch and reentry were precisely calculated for a successful mission. Katherine Johnson's contributions extended beyond the Mercury program. She played a crucial role in the Apollo program, where her calculations were instrumental in the Apollo 11 mission's successful moon landing in 1969. Her work was essential in plotting the trajectory for the lunar module, ensuring that it would rendezvous with the command module and safely return to Earth. Despite facing racial and gender discrimination throughout her career, Katherine Johnson persevered and earned the respect of her colleagues for her unparalleled mathematical skills. Her work was instrumental in advancing the United States' space exploration efforts during a pivotal period in history. In 2015, Katherine Johnson's contributions were brought to the forefront when she was featured in the book 'Hidden Figures' by Margot Lee Shetterly, which later inspired a highly acclaimed movie of the same name. The book and the film highlighted the often-overlooked contributions of African-American women like Johnson to the space program. Katherine Johnson received numerous awards and honors for her groundbreaking work, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2015. She passed away on February 24, 2020, at the age of 101, leaving behind a legacy of excellence in science and mathematics and an inspiration for generations to come. Her contributions to NASA and the space program continue to be celebrated as an essential part of American space history."
